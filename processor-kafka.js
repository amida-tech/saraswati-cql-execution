// const consumer = require('../processor-kafka');
// const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');

// See `processor-kafka-test.js` for working example. Steps for Henry:
// 1. Start a consumer and listen to the topic from the config. 
// 2. Run the measurements against each result, accumulating an object with all the measurements.
// 3. Push this created object to its own produced topic. You will need producer for this.
// That's it.
